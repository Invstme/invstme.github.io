                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FINE TUNE YOUR STORY -</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; Everyone loves a story, this is why people go to movies, read books and search for entertainment. It’s all about feeling like you’re part of something greater than yourself. With most forms of entertainment people merely consume it. As an entrepreneur or investor you go beyond consuming and into the realm of experiencing. Equity investing allows people to experience and be part of something.</span><br></li><li>The greatest innovations took place due to a moving reason or for a need that wasn’t being met. This is where a great product was shown in relation to why it was created. Think about Elon Musk and Space X. It’s all about a product and a reason to believe.</li><li><strong>BUILD AN INVSTME PROFILE -</strong> All potential investors will discover you and your company through your profile. One of the most important aspects about a successful funding round is a brilliant profile. Vision, your plan and transparency are the three key features.</li><li>If you’re an individual who want’s to focus solely on your product and the users we understand that. Play to your strengths! Invstme offers a service where we will build your profile for you and your company. Give us some information to get started and we will give you a personal manager to assist you in the process.</li>
                    <li><strong>TIMELINES - </strong>These are an invaluable resource. To the general public, customer and investor they illustrate growth and movement in your company. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Before launching a funding round you need a few things: early adopters, a press kit/release, social media posts and announcements. Plan both your campaign and the future of your business so the world can see.</span></li><li><strong>WISDOM OF THE CROWD -</strong> In order to raise money for a business you need to show people that it’s a good idea. The problem is that the best way to do that is to already have raised money. It’s a paradox. You want to ensure that people are interested and excited. Let your early adopters and anyone who will listen know that you’re raising funds. This way you have a solid foundation before you even start. </li><li>Think of social media, no one really follows a random Instagram account with only 10 followers. People tend to follow accounts that have hundreds or thousands of followers and it only grows from there. This is an example of “the wisdom of the crowd” at work.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EMAIL EMAIL EMAIL</strong> <strong>-</strong> Email is one of the best means of reaching out to your customer base. These customers already believe in your product, now help them believe in your vision. Start by introducing them to what equity crowdfunding is. The day before your launch let them know what time the campaign begins. Please don’t spam them though. Spamming is very annoying as we all know and is a simple way of loosing a potential customer or investor. Do the same on social media if your customers are easier to access through this means. Make your posts likeable and sharable. Hone your narrative and make them feel privileged to have access as a potential investor.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>THE 3 F's: FRIENDS, FAMILY, FANS&nbsp;-</strong> Equity crowdfunding provides users with a rare chance to be involved in something greater than themselves. With this means, investors are able to interact with founders and get a good look at what happens behind the curtain. Excite the people who have had interactions with your business and the excitement will ripple out from there.</li>
                    <li><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA -</strong> Social media offers a means to show off your business, gain insight on your users, receive feedback and funnel traffic back to your main sight. It allows for a curated view on your business allowing it to seem larger than life. Remember, just like the stock market, people usually don’t pick their investments based on the financials. Most of the time it is due to how the company is perceived by the world.</li><li><strong>THE PHONE CALL OR IN PERSON MEETING -</strong> No one really calls anyone these days. Calling is an easy way of standing out from everyone else. Reach out to a reporter or a potential investor through both email and a simple phone call, it can make all the difference. Another way of showing a person how passionate you are is in person. Your eyes speak volumes. By having an in person meeting a potential investor can both see and hear your passion. Facetime is simply one of the best ways of telling the world who and what you are!</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>REACHING OUT -</strong>&nbsp;A lot of founders have an odd feeling about soliciting customers for funding. You’re not asking them for money, you are offering them a chance to become owners in the company! The early adopters and people who believed in you from the beginning deserve a chance to be part of your company in an integral way. Through equity crowdfunding they have the ability to experience ownership!&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>THE PRESS -</strong>&nbsp;Reporters get pitch emails every day. You need to explain to them why you’re doing what you’re doing. The answer to this is based in both emotion and logic.</li></ul><p><strong>I. </strong><strong>The Emotional Why&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Equity crowdfunding allows users to be part of something larger than themselves. Essentially they are incorporated into the company and are both figuratively and literally part of it!</p><p>They believe in your idea enough to be part of it, true believers are indispensable assets to a business as they are the ones who make it grow.</p><p><strong>II. The Logical Why</strong></p><p>A person who buys your product may tell a few people about how amazing it it. An investor is going to shout it to the world. More importantly, an investor is going to tell you what you’re getting wrong rather than just simply stop using the product.&nbsp;</p><p>By crowdfunding for investments, you have the ability to reach a larger audience and will be able to use the strength of numbers to benefit your company.</p><p>The profile of a user of your product is likely similar to that of potential users. By early adopters becoming investors they now have a vested interest to source more people similar to themselves to use your product or service. By doing so they assist in growing your business which is also their business!</p>

                    <li><strong>WHAT IS IT? -&nbsp;</strong>Equity crowdfunding is a new financial sector. This likely means the general public won’t have much information on what it is, how it’s different from regular crowdfunding and why it’s so innovative.

                    <li><strong>WHAT IS EQUITY CROWDFUNDING? -</strong>&nbsp;It is a process where the general public can invest in an early-stage company in exchange for shares in the company. If the company is successful so are the investors.</li><li><strong>WHAT IS INVSTME? -</strong> Invstme is a platform that assists startups &amp; businesses acquire the necessary funding to grow.

                    <li><strong>HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM KICKSTARTER? -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Invstme wants customers to have a more integral role in your company. With Invstme, customers can own a percentage of your company thereby having a vested interest in it’s success. Kickstarter is one of the best sites out there for entrepreneurs at the moment! We think Kickstarter is fantastic, but Kickstarter is for finished products. Invstme allows you to sell convertible debt, equity and or Bespoke Loan Investments rather than just a finished product. We’re here for you from the day you conceive an idea till the day you deliver it. Invstme is all about building customer relations! What better way to keep your customers than to have them be investors with you as well.</li>

                    <li><strong>PRESS RELEASES -&nbsp;</strong>Reporters and journalists receive pitch emails all the time, what differentiates you from the rest of the businesses? Instead of a generic press release, send a personalized email to every individual you reach out to! After sending an email, follow it up with a phone call. In a world of text, a lone voice stands out.&nbsp;</li><li>It’s great to aim for the big newspapers such as the New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. It’s probably extremely difficult to convince one of them to write a piece on you; so how do you get to that level? Leverage. Start with a community paper and then work your way up the rungs till you reach the top. Nothing about being an entrepreneur is easy but if you put in the effort and time it’s a great start!</li>
                    <li><strong>REACH OUT TO YOUR MARKET'S INFLUENCERS -</strong>&nbsp;A great start to gaining publicity, customers, investors and fans is to reach out to influencers. People who already have a following and would be interested in your product or service. Find a potential customer base, reach out to the person who has access to the base and move forward from there.</li>
                    <li><strong>SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIPS -</strong>&nbsp;Part of being an entrepreneur is about relationships. Like in all aspects of life this cannot be one sided. Talk to journalists and influencers but also make lasting relationships with them. They are doing you a service by getting your story in the paper or on the website but on the other hand you’re giving them a good story. Keep in touch with them and let them know how things are going, they too believed in you in order to have written about you.</li><li><strong>AVAILABILITY -</strong> Remember to listen and give time to your investors. These people are now part of your company but more importantly, they believed in you. Remember to give them the gratitude and respect they deserve. Always have someone monitoring your profile, emails and messages to respond to any questions, suggestions or comments from your new community. They invested in your vision, remember that!</li>
